 #include <iostream> //* This is important to the functionality of the stream....
 using namespace std; //* important to not needing to type std.cout a million times.
 
 int main()//* this is when the program starts this is the main function
 {
     int studentID = 0; //? set the value? based on student?
     cout<<"Please enter a student ID number: "; //? shouldnt this be first? then the cin?
     cin >> studentID; //* where user would enter value
 
     cout<<"Hello World! "<<studentID<<endl; //? shouldnt this say the student's name based on input? THIS IS TEXT OUTPUT
 }
 
 Steps for algorithm
 1. Integer for student id
 2. ouputs "Please enter a student ID number: "
 3. allows student to enter their ID number
 4. prints text: hello world.
 5. prints text: studentID
 
//Identify with a //* 2-3 items that seem important
//Identify with a //? 2-3 items that seem incorrect, unclear or where you have questions
//Identify the different parts of the program.
//Create comments that show the algorithm of the program.
